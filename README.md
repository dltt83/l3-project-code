# l3-project-code

This repository holds code for my personal Level 3 project at Durham University

The project involved a psychological study to asses whether associations to consonant and dissonant musical intervals can be chnage by gameplay.
The code in this repo was used for the game the participants played.

This code was developped on the Gorilla platform [(gorilla.sc)](https://gorilla.sc/) and edited to work with the 'Live Server' extension in VS Code [(ritwickdey.LiveServer)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

## Setup

Clone the github repo

Using VS Code, and the Live Server extension, use the 'Go Live' button in the bottom right.

This will open server on port 5500 by default.

Go to http://127.0.0.1:5500/ and game should be running in the web page.
